Star Revenge 0 - Galaxy of Origins v1.0.4

SM64 Hack by BroDute

Original Game by Nintendo

This is a medium difficulty hack with 122 stars. There are 15 main courses and they all have 8 stars. Once you get the 2 intro stars you are free to choose any level to play in any order. The final can be unlocked by collecting 50 stars.

This hack has nothing to do with SR0.5, it has its own original levels and isn't based off any of my other hacks.

If you are interested in what order to play the many Star Revenges, then follow this order as recommended (this is lore-wise, not necessarily in order of difficulty):

SR0 GoO -> SR1.5 STRedone 2.X -> SR2 To the Moon -> (SR2.5 RoD ->) SR3.5 VoCD -> (SR3.9 DBB ->) SR4.5 TKTR -> SR6.25 LADX -> SR6.5 WotDF -> SR6.9 LliT -> SR5 NBR -> SR7 PoT -> SR7.5 KR -> SR8 SoH -> SR5.5 DM
[the missing numbers can be ignored, because those hacks got remade or are just not worth it to play in general]
